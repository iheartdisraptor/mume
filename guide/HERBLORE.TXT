                                   HERBLORES

### Important! You CAN NOT mix herblore if you not obtained speacial book/etc
### writing from the certain mob, even if you already know all components
### needed for lore. If you will try it, you will always produce "unknown
### mishmash" instead of lore. But even if you have lore in your list (use
### "herblores" command while having herbal kit in equipment), you can fail
### attempt to make lore if you have low WIS. It is why for warrior/thief it's
### better to give lores/components to friend caster to mix the lore.

with certain herbs to defend ourselves from this vicious danger, if we know how
to use them. Unfortunately, any remedy we hope to make will be very complex. The
simplest, and most effective, is outlined below.

First, a base is made with two handfuls of blackberries, because of their
healthy juice. Water lily petals, to purify the blood, and figwort, to purge the
stomach, make that a thick paste. Finally the healing properties of the
kingsfoil make it really efficient.

and water, but as well purge your body from the somewhat annoying effects of any
potions.

				    Leaf-cake

  Description:
There are some situations when one needs all the courage and strength he can
muster. In those critical situations, even the most common flu can turn a
fearsome warrior into a dull mass of flaccid muscles. As the most prompt to ill
race, humans have soon learned how to use herbs to cure the flu, among them
thyme and sage were the most renowned. Later, one particular flower, formerly
raised by the Entwives, appeared to have even greater healing virtues. From
this flower, often called coneflower, a very effective treatment can be made to
heal the average flu.

First of all one has to use honey as a base, but also to relieve the inflamed
throat. Thyme and sage leaves should then be added, as their healing powers
will greatly help the patient. The whole coneflower should then be mixed into
the paste to help fight the infection and strengthen the body. Finally, the
large leaves of the coneflower can be used to wrap the mixture, producing a
sort of leaf-cake.

                                   Arachnia
  Description:
Among the beasts of our lands, the spiders are the most feared, mostly because
they sting their victim and inject a poison which slows their moves and their
brain. Thanks to a careful study of the grey spider anatomia, we have been able
to use the venom sack of this beast to produce a terribly dangerous poison. In a
bowl, crush the tail of a young salamander into a shapeless pulp. Add the fur of
a bat to stabilize the components, and, most important, the fluid sack of a grey
spider. The sack must have been butchered recently from the monster, and kept in
a wet sack during its transport. Mix the three ingredients until a brownish
liquid is obtained.

                                  Belladonna

know the use of three natural ingredients can produce a mild poison. Crush
carefully the tongue of a frog in a vial, as base for your concoction. Get a
freshly recolted Belladonna, the plant known for its dangerous properties. Use
the fruits or the leaves of the plant, for it is where its essence is mostly
concentrated. Add then a red mushroom, the sort which gives headache and
dizziness when eaten. Mix the reagents and seal the liquid in a vial. That
draught will weaken your opponent, who will lose an important part of his
skills. It can of course be used to poison your arrows or your blade.

                                 Drake-slumber
  Description:
This is the recipe of a brew which should be able to debilitate even a very
powerful beast - one which would not succumb to ordinary magic or weaker potions
and poisons.

  The sticky pulp of a fresh milkweed plant will make a ready base for the
draught. All parts of thisplant cause weakness and staggering, then prostration,
laboured breathing and a profound sleep. This should serve to slow and weaken
the creature, despite its strength and size. To the base add some valerian root
and the flowers of the mountain poppy - these herbs act to tranquilise and to
alter the workings of the mind. They also inhibit aggression, which will be most
important in controlling the beast.

  Leaves, flowers and fruit of the hemlock plant will weaken the animal, slowing
its heart and suppressing its breathing. A single fly agaric mushroom is also
needed - the flesh of this bright red fungus is said to bring on dizziness and a
lack of coordination, followed by a deep sleep.

  To complete the brew one white fruit of the baneberry plant is needed. This
strong poison will weaken the creature, and should further assist in bringing
about dizziness and poor flow of the blood.

chamber stand two stone guardians. One of them have an alchemical journal, that

know the use of the herbs can produce a whole set of curing concoctions, and of
deadly mixtures also. This is the formula for one of the worst. Carefully crush

                                   Psylonia
  Description:
Anyone who ate the wrong mushroom knows that the effects of mushroom intoxication
can be really surprising. Headache, dizziness, hallucinations are some of the
possible symptoms. Some people, like the inhabitants of the remote land known as
Yuka Taan, south of Harad, use mushrooms as a drug. Others have found a more
warlike usage. The orcs of the east know many preparations based on mushrooms.
One of the most efficient, a poison which does not kill the victims, but drains
them and stop their concentration, is described here.

  The base is made by a handful of inkberries from Hollin. A red mushroom is
crushed with the berries, to thicken the paste. The third ingredient is the most
important: the rare, sickly green, mushroom. It must be added before the
concoction is mixed. Few people have ever found this mushroom: it is rumoured to
grow in humid caves or in the darkest forests of the land.
